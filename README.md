# Skin-Classification-Convolutional-Decision-tree
Dermatology may be one among the major sessionsof drugs that is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment ofskin diseases. Skin diseases are a common cause of human illnessbecause of various factors that affect skin like pollution, hygiene,hormonal problems, climate change etc..Due to the similarappearance of skin diseases and its wide range of types andcharacteristics, automatic classification through affected images isquite a challenging task.This uncertainty or incorrect assumptionabout the condition can lead into the wrong course of treatmentand further cause distress to the patients and even delay in thetreatment. We propose a skin diseases diagnosis system usingconvolutional neural network and Decision tree techniques thatallow users to identify diseases of the human skin. Further wehave used image processing techniques like digital hair removalalgorithm to remove noise and to improve accuracy. Finally, theresults are shown to the user about the type of disease. Thesystem successfully detects 7 different types of skin diseases withan accuracy rate of 94%.
